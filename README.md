# dkml-workflows-regular-example

A "regular" example for the [dkml-workflows](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
collection of GitHub Action workflows. DKML helps you
distribute native OCaml applications on the most common operating systems.
In particular the [setup-dkml.yml@v0] of [dkml-workflows] builds:
* Windows libraries and executables with the traditional Visual Studio compiler, avoiding hard-to-debug runtime issued caused by compiler incompatibilities
* macOS libraries and executables for both Intel and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) architectures
* Linux libraries and executables on an ancient "glibc" C library, letting you distribute your software to most Linux users
  while avoiding the alternative approach of [static linking the system C library](https://gavinhoward.com/2021/10/static-linking-considered-harmful-considered-harmful/)

The full list of examples is:

> Before using these examples be sure to read the [advantages and disadvantages of setup-workflow][setup-dkml.yml@v0].
> One particular limitation is that, as of today, [setup-dkml.yml@v0] only supports OCaml 4.12.1.

These workflows are **not quick** and won't improve unless you are willing to contribute PRs!
Expect to wait approximately:

You can see an example workflow at https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows-regular-example/actions/workflows/package.yml

[1] `setup-dkml/macos-darwin_all` is doing double-duty: it is compiling x86_64 and arm64 systems.
